The pizza project aims to implement an interpreter for an assembler language.
The spec will be uploaded in a few days, but for now here is an outline of the
project.

## Why

Because it sounds like fun, and is unique.

## Pre Spec/ General plan

* RISC isa.
* Written in C.
* Custom Assembler lang, called slice.
* Either register or stack based (Must still decide).

## TODO

- [ ] Design ebnf for `slice` lang.
- [ ] Create a formal spec.
- [ ] Decide on instruction's.
